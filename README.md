# Virtual Tour Editor with Pannellum

Easily build interactive 360° tours with hotspots between scenes.

## 🛠 How to Use

1. Open `index.html` using Live Server in VS Code or any local server
2. Upload your 360° images
3. Add hotspots to navigate between scenes
4. Save the tour (generates `virtual-tour.json`)
5. Replace `virtual-tour.json` and images in the repo

## ▶️ How to View the Tour

1. Place all images in the `images/` folder
2. Make sure `virtual-tour.json` uses filenames (e.g. `images/scene1.jpg`)
3. Open `viewer.html` in Live Server to view your full tour

## ⚠️ Notes

- Do **not** open HTML files via double-click — use Live Server or host with a static server
- All images must be in `images/` folder with matching filenames from the editor
